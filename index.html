      <section>
          <p>I am nervous, Femi has barely acknowledge my presence since we left the airport and entered the car, The drive to his parents’ house has been unusually quiet but he seem not to notice, all he has been doing was endlessly scrolling through his phone, his handsome face set into a grim expression that unnerves me. </p>
          <p>I sighed and adjust my sitting position so I could see him without having to twist my neck or strain my eyes. When he smiled at his phone, something in me relax, I reached out and place my hand on his knee, gently squeezed the way he loves but I felt him go tense under my touch and shift his knee out of reach, I felt like he just pushed a dagger right into my chest. I don’t know what I was expecting, perhaps a reassuring smile or even a sigh, anything to break the tension between us, not only was his rejection a punch to my gut, I miss his touch and the way his eyes danced when he smiled at me.</p>
             <p> “Femi……..”
             I flinched at the despair and anguish in my voice but he did not bulge. Our ride is almost over, I could see the big exterior of his parents’ Villa, its huge gate heavily guarded by private bodyguards in well-tailored blazer suits. </p>
     <p> “Femi….” I tried again, soft and calmly as we drove into the majestic home of the Coker’s.
       “Femi, I ……”
      <p>“Put on your best smile” He cut me off without sparing me a glance, his hand already on the door<p>            
          <p> “Do not embarrass me” </p>
          <p><em>He got out of the car, paused for me to get out and adjust my outfit, then we walk side by side without saying a word to each other.  Where is my husband? Help! This is not the man I married!  The man smiling as I walk up the aisle, The man that kissed my hand gently after putting the wedding ring on it, for better, for worse. Till death part us!   I keep up with his pace and managed to put on my convincing smile as we exchanged pleasantries with his family, suppressing the lumps in my throat. Surrounded by the white wall and the Coker’s affectionate ways, Femi chatted merrily, I felt overwhelmed with all these people, I found my way to the restroom, my throat was dry, my chest was heavy, I swallowed the lumps in my throat but I was so tired of holding back my tears, I welcomed them, not even bothering to keep it together. I know my makeup would be ruined but I had no strength to pretend. Things are not going on fine in my home and my husband has turn to a complete stranger.</em></p>
      
        
        <p>A tap on the door jolted me out of my thought, I wipe my face. <p>
        <p>“Coming!” </p>
      <p> “Ife, what happened? Are you okay? You have been in here for long” Lo said as soon as I opened the door.</p>
     <p> “I’m okay….” I lied and turn away before she could see my eyes. Too late, her eyes were already skimming my face.</p>
     <p> “You have been crying” she said in a calm voice “Your eyes are red and puffy, what is wrong, Ife?”</p>
      <p>“C’mon Lo!” I put on a bright smile, hoping to convince her.  His sister does not need to know about us, it would only piss Femi off the most, I know how he don’t like having his family members indulging in his private affairs. “Nothing is wrong, Just……Jet Lag” I shrugged.</p>
      <p>She raised her brow in disbelief. “It’s Femi right? Rumor has it that he has been cheating on you, is that true?”  My knee gave way and I had to lean on the door for support.</p>
      <p> “I am sorry, I did not mean to startle you…” She sighed “I… I just could not believe it. I find it absurd because you both love each other and we all know how much Femi worships and adore you. He would not do that to you right? It`s just three years!” I could not find my voice, I gave a weak nod</p>
      <p>“I hope you don’t believe all those gist mongers.” She reached out to touch my face, gently soothing my cheeks with the back of her palm” They would publish anything on their blog, just to make money and get more followers!”</p>
      <p>“I don’t know what to believe. He has really changed Lo. He hardly say a word to me anymore, he is now cold and….distant, it’s strange, I don’t know what to do…..”</p>
     <p> “Something might be eating him up. Business deals, we both know Femi. Trust him to keep all that Info to himself”</p>
     <p> “That was my thought at first, but it is way more than that”</p>
      <p>“Domestic Violence?”</p>
     <p><em> “No!”</em> I waved away her look of concern.</p>
     <p> “I suggest you should both consult a marriage counsellor, Perhaps that would help him open up and you can find solution for whatever is eating him up or do you want me to talk to him?”</p>
      <p>“No, no Lou. Thanks but no” </p>
     <p> “Everything will be fine, sweetheart” She pulled me in her arms and it was very comforting. Just what I needed. “I have never seen you down so bad like this Ife, I’ve always known you to be strong, always full of life and I respect you a lot, keeping your home and managing at work"</p>
         <p> I smiled, Lo was lifting my spirit with her kind words
      “Don’t get so worked up, my dear, just talk to your man and have him open up to you. I’m sure you have dealt with more tough guys in the office, but this is your man, you got this!” She squeezed my hand gently</p>
     <p> “Thank you, Lo. Thank you for your kind words”
        “You are welcome sweetie. Now clean up your face and fix your makeup, let’s join the others”</p>

       <h2>Chapter Two</h2>
       <p>Anxiety was eating me up. My hands trembled as I check my reflection in the mirror and I could see the absent look in my eyes, I sat up straight, massaging the back of my neck to ease the throbbing pain I feel there while waiting for Femi to get out of the shower so we could talk or at least, make him talk to me, my heart jumped whenever I hear him move. Okay, do not panic, everything would be fine! 
        I had a busy day at work today and all I want to do is sleep but I was so determined to have this conversation with him before I go to bed. I’m tempted to enter the bathroom to meet him, even though I’ve had my shower few minutes ago. We used to enjoy sharing the bathroom, once upon a time where the bath tub was used for more than just bathing, now it seems like an impossible fantasy. I sighed dreamily and my nipples tighten in a craving peak, aroused by the memories of our 
        
        The door opened and Femi stepped out, towel hanging carelessly on his waist, unbothered by the water glinting off his body, his dark skin shinning and glowing under the light, My god! He’s beautiful!
        My heart gave a start when he walked towards me, he usually likes to kiss my shoulder, while our eyes held in the mirror, but I was disappointed when he walked pass me and move towards the closet. I blushed when the towel gave way to expose his well-toned butt cheek, I did not get to enjoy the view for long as he quickly slide on his favorite silk pajamas, the one I got for him when I was on a business trip in Hong Kong. I looked away when he turned to look at me, I could not get the flushed look off my face which is silly since I’m his wife and he’s my husband, Not like I’m spying on some random Adonis
        I sighed.  Has it come to this? This guilt just for staring at him naked! What happened to us!</p>
        
        <p>“Do you intend to seat there all night?”  His voice boomerang from across the room. I lifted my head and our gaze met, He was on the bed looking like a demi-god, the sky-blue bedspread like a cloud against his athletic build</p>
        
       <p> “No, just about to…..” I gesticulated wildly but he did not even blink nor averted his gaze. Suddenly feeling shy and body conscious, I wrapped my arms around my body, wishing they were his. I shivered, I still had my wet towel around me</p>
       <p> “Get dressed, will you” His voice was bland, he looked away as I reached for robe, He used to love watching me dress and undress, just as much as I love to gawk at him. Private exhibition, we used to call them. It saddens me that used to apply to a lot of things in our marriage, but at least we still share the same bed! I swallowed hard at the realization that if we continue like thus, one of us might have to move to one of the guest room, if not moving out entirely, which will be followed by scandals and divorce. Enough with the bad thoughts already! I shrugged and shake my head but the feeling of doom won’t leave me alone, like a countdown to disaster, and I could not live like that, I would not let things get that bad
       </p>
        
         <p>“Femi….. We need to talk” I fought hard to compose myself, biting my lower lips. He was on bed, looking like a demi god, giving me a bemused look, but he did not answer my question</p>
        
       <p> “Please Femi, I…….” You hardly say a word to me, you don’t look at me, you don’t even….touch me…”</p>
        
       <p> He gave a low grunt. “I don’t have time for this, Ife, I have to be up early in the morning”</p>
        
       <p> “Same here too, I.……”</p>
        
        <p>“That” He hissed “is your problem, not mine” I was stunned by his harsh tone 
        
        I was not ready to back down. I stood in the middle of the room, staring at him, shaking inside but still determined to have this conversation.</p> 
        
       <p> “You have changed, Femi” I said softly, changing my tactics “Ever since we lost the baby”</p>
        
        <p>“And whose fault was that?” The tone in his voice carried no emotion. I was lost for some moment, trying to figure out what he meant by that, when the realization dawn on me, it hurts deep into my soul. I could feel my heart beating loudly against my chest</p>
        
       <p> “You are blaming me for that?” I fight back hot tears, willing my body to stay strong and not fail me. He clenched his jaws, just staring at me. “Femi, our baby! My first child!” I wailed, suddenly out of breath.</p> 
        
       <p> “No, do not do that!” I cried. “Do not blame me, that was my baby too, I carried it!” I guffawed, trying to hide how deep the scar burned. My eyes were starting to get misty with tears. Nothing is more heartbreaking than knowing he has been blaming me for my miscarriage. He opened his mouth to speak but then he sighed and looked away.</p>
          <p>In that brief moment, I saw the hurt in his eyes and it caught me off guard. The realization that he I hurt as well, that he might be holding himself accountable too. I moved to his side of the bed, reached out to touch him but he flinched, “Femi, I know you are angry and hurt, so am I too, but it hurts more that you are giving me cold shoulders in this dire time”</p>
        
        <p>After a long pause that seem like forever, he speaks “I begged you to take breaks from work after your second trimester but you never listened me! I told you to go easy and avoid the stress and work load you were putting on yourself but no - all you ever think about was your work! And I blame myself, I have allowed this to go on for a long time! I’ve always supported your career, never imposed anything on you, but you blew our first chance of being a family. I was so looking forward to that, thinking it would give you more time and allow you focus on us being a family, but I was wrong! You put your work first, you don’t care about my feelings, you don’t care about the baby, your negligence cost us our first child, our baby! You lost the baby on a field trip I begged you not to go on. Forgive me for having doubt about us, but I can’t help it”</p>
        
       <p> “Oh baby!” With tears in my eyes, I reached out to him again but he moved away from my grasp.</p>
        
       <p> “Femi, I am sorry! I never knew you felt this way” I sniffed back tears “I should have listened to you, I was so blinded with work, trying to get to the top echelon of the business world that I neglected the most important thing in my life which is family, and it cost me a lot, believe me! The past few weeks have been so hard on me, I don’t want to lose you!  I am so sorry you have to share in this pain, but that is why we have each other¸ things do not have to continue like this Femi, I am begging you” He was quiet and I could see different emotions played out on his face.</p>
        
        
       <p> “Femi, please we need to go for therapy, we need to see a marriage counsellor and talk things through!” </p>
        
       <p> He scoffed. “I will not be going through with that!”</p>
        
       <p> “Please femi! It’s been months since we lost the baby yet you won’t look at me, you haven’t even touched me, we… we could make another” I said in frustration
        
        His eyes met mine, and it fell on my cleavage, I could see the answering flint of desire in his eyes, something I haven’t seen in a long time, and it awakened my feminine power, 			
        I wanted it to last, I want more. I smuggled closer to him and this time, he did not push away, his shirt was opened, I traced my finger on his bare chest and my fingers brushed his hardened nipple, a groan escaped from his throat.</p>
        
       <p> “Stop it...” He warned </p>
         
        <p>I did not yield, I dropped my hand lower and his perfectly fitted abs felt like rock under my palm.
        I missed touching him. I traced my finger lower, down to his groin, I could see his growing erection and it gave me so much confidence to go on.</p>
        
        <p>“Stop it Ife, I am not in the mood” He said, trying to push my hand away, but his hand stilled when I touched him through the fabric he was putting on, his boner throbbed in my hands, I moan with my own desire, I proceed to pull down his trousers from his waist but he held my hand.  
        
        There was a long pause.  </p>
        
       <p> “Take it off.” He nod at my nightwear. His voice was harsh. It gave me the chills and I could not read the meaning on his face. I hesitate for some seconds before I obliged. His eyes lingered on my boobs, they felt heavy, waiting to be touched and suckle on after a long time, I shivered under his gaze as his eyes danced all over my body. </p>
        
       <p> “They look bigger” He said, his eyes on my boobs and I could see the hungry look in them.</p>
        
        <p>I swallowed hard. “Yes……pregnancy hormones”<p>
        
       <p> He frowned. A dark look replaced the frown on his face</p>
        
       <p> “Femi….” I called out in fear, unsure of his next move
        
        He moved closer, his face was so close to mine. I closed my eyes, waiting for him to kiss me, my body yearning for his touch but he did not, I opened my eyes and I saw him staring at me, his gaze piercing into my soul<p>
        
       <p> “I cannot give you what you want” He got up and left the bed</p>
        
       <p> I sighed in frustration “Are you cheating on me?” I asked in soft tones. 
        
        He slowly turned back to face me, with an angry face “What gives you that impression?”</p>
